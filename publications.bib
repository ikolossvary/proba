	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a sponge in Rd\$\mathbb {R}^d\$ is the attractor of an iterated function system consisting of finitely many strictly contracting affine maps whose linear part is a diagonal matrix. A suitable separation condition is introduced under which a variational formula is proved for the Lq\$L^q\$ spectrum of any self-affine measure defined on a sponge for all q∈R\$q\in \mathbb {R}\$. Apart from some special cases, even the existence of their box dimension was not proved before. Under certain conditions, the formula has a closed form which in general is an upper bound. The Frostman and box dimension of these measures is also determined. The approach unifies several existing results and extends them to arbitrary dimensions. The key ingredient is the introduction of a novel pressure function which aims to capture the growth rate of box counting quantities on sponges. We show that this pressure satisfies a variational principle which resembles the Ledrappier–Young formula for Hausdorff dimension.},

We show that the rate of growth of this cover time is determined by the Minkowski dimension of the push-forward of the shift invariant measure with exponential decay of correlations driving the chaos game. Moreover, we bound the expected value of the cover time from above and below with multiplicative logarithmic correction terms. As an application, for Bedford–McMullen carpets, we completely characterise the family of probability vectors that minimise the Minkowski dimension of Bernoulli measures. Interestingly, these vectors have not appeared in any other aspect of Bedford–McMullen carpets before.}",

	abstract = {We construct a family of planar self-affine carpets with overlaps using lower triangular matrices in a way that generalizes the original Gatzouras–Lalley carpets (Gatzouras and Lalley 1992 Indiana Univ. Math. J. 41 533–68) defined by diagonal matrices. Assuming the rectangular open set condition, Barański (2008 Discrete Continuous Dyn. Syst. A 21 1015–23) proved for this construction that for typical parameters, which can be explicitly checked, the inequalities between the Hausdorff, box and affinity dimension of the attractor are strict. We generalize this result to overlapping constructions, where we allow complete columns to be shifted along the horizontal axis (as in Fraser and Shmerkin (2016 Ergod. Theor. Dyn. Syst. 36 2463–81) and Pardo-Simón (2019 Ergod. Theor. Dyn. Syst. pp 733–63) or allow parallelograms to overlap within a column in a transversal way. Our main result is to show sufficient conditions under which these overlaps do not cause a drop of the dimension of the attractor. Several examples are provided to illustrate the results, including a self-affine smiley, a family of self-affine continuous curves, examples with overlaps and an application of our results to some three-dimensional systems.}
