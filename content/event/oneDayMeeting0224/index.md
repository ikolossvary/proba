Title: *Variational Principle for Anosov groups of matrices*   
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
We consider a discrete group of $(d \times d)$-matrices. There is a geometric growth rate (the "Falconer dimension") that generalizes the Poincar√© exponent of discrete groups of $(2\times 2)$-matrices. Under some hyperbolicity assumptions, we relate this growth rate to the supremum of the "Lyapunov dimensions" associated to random walks on the group. This is joint work with P. Lessa (Montevideo) and a generalization of a recent paper by Jiao, Li, Pan, and Xu.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
