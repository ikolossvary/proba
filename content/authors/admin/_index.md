István Kolossváry is a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellow at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics. His main area of interest lies in the broad area of dynamical systems and more specifically the dimension theory of fractal sets and measures arising from various contexts. He has also worked on first passage percolation problems on random graphs before.
