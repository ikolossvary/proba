I am a research fellow in pure mathematics at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics in Budapest, Hungary. I currently hold a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowship titled *New perspectives on the box counting dimension of sets and measures*. My main area of interest lies in the broad area of dynamical systems and more specifically the dimension theory of fractal sets and measures arising from various contexts. I have also worked on first passage percolation problems on random graphs.
