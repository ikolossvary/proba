## Conference talks

- *The Assouad spectrum of Lalley-Gatzouras carpets*.    
[Fractal Geometry Workshop](https://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/2023/fractal-geometry), ICMS, Edinburgh, UK; July 3-7, 2023.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
Fraser and Yu determined the Assouad spectrum of Bedford-McMullen carpets when they introduced this new dimension spectra in 2018. In the talk, I will highlight interesting new phenomena that the spectrum exhibits in the more general Lalley-Gatzouras class. Based on joint work with Jonathan M. Fraser and Amlan Banaji.

- *A variational principle for box counting quantities*.    
[Thermodynamic Formalism: Non-additive Aspects and Related Topics](https://www.impan.pl/en/activities/banach-center/conferences/23-thermoform), Bedlewo, PL; May 14-19, 2023.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
The classical variational principle for topological pressure is an essential tool in thermodynamic formalism. The aim of the talk is to extend the framework into a non-conformal setting where we prove a variational principle for an appropriate pressure that is specifically tailored to calculate box counting quantities. Similarities and differences between the variational principles will be highlighted. As an application, we can derive the {{< math >}}$L^q${{< /math >}} spectrum of self-affine measures supported on planar carpets and higher dimensional sponges.

- *Various dimensions of self-affine measures on sponges*.   
[Fractals and Related Fields IV (FARF)](https://farf4.math.cnrs.fr/), Isle de Porquerolles, FR; September 5-9, 2022.

- *On the Convergence Rate of the Chaos Game*.    
[7th Cornell Conference on Analysis, Probability, and Mathematical Physics on Fractals](https://alexander-teplyaev.uconn.edu/cornell7/speakers/), Cornell University, NY, USA; June 4-8, 2022.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
This talk will address the question: how long does it take for the orbit of the chaos game to reach a certain density inside the attractor of a strictly contracting IFS of which we only assume that its lower dimension is positive? We show that the rate of growth of this cover time is determined by the Minkowski dimension of the push-forward of the shift invariant measure with exponential decay of correlations driving the chaos game. As an application, for Bedford-McMullen carpets, we completely characterize the family of probability vectors that minimize the Minkowski dimension of Bernoulli measures. Based on joint work with B. Bárány and N. Jurga.

- *The $L^q$ spectrum of self-affine measures on sponges*.   
[Workshop on affine and overlapping iterated function systems 2022](http://www.troscheit.eu/workshop2022/index.html), University of Bristol, UK; May 10-12, 2022.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
In this talk we consider self-affine sponges in Rd which satisfy a separation condition that gives a certain grid alignment to first level cylinder sets. On the plane these are precisely the Lalley-Gatzouras and Bara\'nski carpets. We show that the Lq spectrum of any self-affine measure supported on such a sponge satisfies a variational formula for all q∈R. Sufficient conditions are given for the formula to have a closed form. In particular, this is always the case for the box dimension of the sponge. The Frostman and box dimension of these measures is also determined. The result is derived from a more general variational principle for calculating box counting quantities on sponges which resembles the Ledrappier-Young formula for Hausdorff dimension and could be of interest to further study in its own right.

- *Intermediate dimensions of Bedford--McMullen carpets*.   
[Junior Ergodic Theory Meeting](https://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/2022/junior-ergodic-theory-meeting), ICMS, Edinburgh, UK; March 28-31, 2022.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
Intermediate dimensions were recently introduced to provide a spectrum of dimensions interpolating between Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions for fractals where these differ. In particular, the self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets are a natural case for investigation, but until now only very rough bounds for their intermediate dimensions have been found. The aim of the talk is to present a precise formula for the full spectrum with some intuition behind it. Moreover, to highlight a surprising connection of the intermediate dimensions to the multifractal spectrum and Lipschitz equivalence of these carpets. Based on joint work with Amlan Banaji.

## Event organisation

This webpage collects all professional activities conducted during my Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowship titled *New perspectives on the box counting dimension of sets and measures* starting Jan. 1, 2024.

{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
Fractal geometry is a young, very active and rapidly growing field of research that is connected to different areas of mathematics and the natural sciences. Roughly speaking, dimension theory is concerned with measuring the ‘size’ of sets by defining different notions of dimension. At the center of NewBoxDim is the box counting dimension which is a fundamental concept within mathematics that has found applications outside of mathematics as well.

The main objective of NewBoxDim is to open new perspectives on the study of the box dimension of sets and measures by exploring three very recent alternative approaches. In the first approach, the goal is to 
develop unifying machinery based on thermodynamic formalism in order to tackle a long-standing open problem about the existence of the box dimension of self-affine sets. In the second approach, we aim to fuse ideas from dimension theory and methods 
from percolation theory in a novel way to study the fine scale structure and connectivity properties of different fractal percolation models. The third and final objective of NewBoxDim is to advance our understanding about the time evolution of the chaos game 
whose convergence rate is determined by the box dimension of the measure driving this stochastic point process. We aim to obtain more nuanced information by making an interesting connection to the {{< math >}}$L^q${{< /math >}} spectrum (also known as generalized fractal dimensions) of the measure and characterizing the measure which minimizes its box dimension. As an interdisciplinary application, our results on the chaos game could have a direct impact on the Chaos Game Representation (and its variants) which is a method that was developed to analyze genomic sequences in bioinformatics.
