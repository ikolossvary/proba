## Conference talks

- *The Assouad spectrum of Lalley-Gatzouras carpets*.    
[Fractal Geometry Workshop](https://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/2023/fractal-geometry), ICMS, Edinburgh, UK; July 3-7, 2023.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
Fraser and Yu determined the Assouad spectrum of Bedford-McMullen carpets when they introduced this new dimension spectra in 2018. In the talk, I will highlight interesting new phenomena that the spectrum exhibits in the more general Lalley-Gatzouras class. Based on joint work with Jonathan M. Fraser and Amlan Banaji.

- *A variational principle for box counting quantities*.    
[Thermodynamic Formalism: Non-additive Aspects and Related Topics](https://www.impan.pl/en/activities/banach-center/conferences/23-thermoform), Bedlewo, PL; May 14-19, 2023.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
The classical variational principle for topological pressure is an essential tool in thermodynamic formalism. The aim of the talk is to extend the framework into a non-conformal setting where we prove a variational principle for an appropriate pressure that is specifically tailored to calculate box counting quantities. Similarities and differences between the variational principles will be highlighted. As an application, we can derive the {{< math >}}$L^q${{< /math >}} spectrum of self-affine measures supported on planar carpets and higher dimensional sponges.

[Fractals and Related Fields IV (FARF)](https://farf4.math.cnrs.fr/), Isle de Porquerolles, FR; September 5-9, 2022.

- *On the Convergence Rate of the Chaos Game*.    
[7th Cornell Conference on Analysis, Probability, and Mathematical Physics on Fractals](https://alexander-teplyaev.uconn.edu/cornell7/speakers/), Cornell University, NY, USA; June 4-8, 2022.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
This talk will address the question: how long does it take for the orbit of the chaos game to reach a certain density inside the attractor of a strictly contracting IFS of which we only assume that its lower dimension is positive? We show that the rate of growth of this cover time is determined by the Minkowski dimension of the push-forward of the shift invariant measure with exponential decay of correlations driving the chaos game. As an application, for Bedford-McMullen carpets, we completely characterize the family of probability vectors that minimize the Minkowski dimension of Bernoulli measures. Based on joint work with B. Bárány and N. Jurga.

- *The $L^q$ spectrum of self-affine measures on sponges*.   
[Workshop on affine and overlapping iterated function systems 2022](http://www.troscheit.eu/workshop2022/index.html), University of Bristol, UK; May 10-12, 2022.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
In this talk we consider self-affine sponges in Rd which satisfy a separation condition that gives a certain grid alignment to first level cylinder sets. On the plane these are precisely the Lalley-Gatzouras and Bara\'nski carpets. We show that the $L^q$ spectrum of any self-affine measure supported on such a sponge satisfies a variational formula for all real values of $q$. Sufficient conditions are given for the formula to have a closed form. In particular, this is always the case for the box dimension of the sponge. The Frostman and box dimension of these measures is also determined. The result is derived from a more general variational principle for calculating box counting quantities on sponges which resembles the Ledrappier-Young formula for Hausdorff dimension and could be of interest to further study in its own right.

- *Intermediate dimensions of Bedford--McMullen carpets*.   
[Junior Ergodic Theory Meeting](https://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/2022/junior-ergodic-theory-meeting), ICMS, Edinburgh, UK; March 28-31, 2022.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
Intermediate dimensions were recently introduced to provide a spectrum of dimensions interpolating between Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions for fractals where these differ. In particular, the self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets are a natural case for investigation, but until now only very rough bounds for their intermediate dimensions have been found. The aim of the talk is to present a precise formula for the full spectrum with some intuition behind it. Moreover, to highlight a surprising connection of the intermediate dimensions to the multifractal spectrum and Lipschitz equivalence of these carpets. Based on joint work with Amlan Banaji.

## Seminar talks

- *Assouad spectrum of planar carpets*.   
[BudWiSer - The Budapest - Wien Dynamics Seminar](https://mathematik.univie.ac.at/forschung/seminare/the-budapest-wien-dynamics-seminar/), January 12,  2024.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
There are plenty of examples of sets, such as planar carpets, whose box and Assouad dimensions are different. The Assouad spectrum is a one parameter family of dimensions which gives additional information about the fine scale geometry of such sets. In the talk, we will present a formula for the Assouad spectrum of Gatzouras-Lalley carpets. We will highlight why it can be expressed as the concave conjugate of an explicit piecewise-analytic function and, among dynamically invariant sets, what novel features does the spectrum exhibit. Based on joint work with A. Banaji, J.M. Fraser and A. Rutar.

- *On the convergence rate of the chaos game*.   
[Universit\"{a}t Bremen Dynamical Systems and Geometry Seminar]({https://www.uni-bremen.de/dynamical-systems/seminars/detailansicht?tx_sfeventmgt_pievent%5Baction%5D=detail&tx_sfeventmgt_pievent%5Bcontroller%5D=Event&tx_sfeventmgt_pievent%5Bevent%5D=3545&tx_sfeventmgt_pievent%5Blayout%5D=1&cHash=e3008e2c6756574cd03b849dc12996f5), December 1, 2023.
{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
The chaos game is a simple random iterative procedure that generates the attractor of an iterated function system (IFS). This talk will address the question: given a measure driving the chaos game, how long does it take for the orbit of a point to reach a certain density inside the attractor? We show under mild assumptions on the IFS and the measure that the rate of growth of this cover time is determined by the Minkowski dimension of the measure. The results will be illustrated with examples, particularly in finding the measure which achieves the fastest possible rate of convergence. Based on joint work with Balázs Bárány and Natalia Jurga.
