abstract: We construct a family of planar self-affine carpets with overlaps using
  lower triangular matrices in a way that generalizes the original Gatzouras–Lalley
  carpets (Gatzouras and Lalley 1992 Indiana Univ. Math. J. 41 533–68) defined by
  diagonal matrices. Assuming the rectangular open set condition, Barański (2008 Discrete
  Continuous Dyn. Syst. A 21 1015–23) proved for this construction that for typical
  parameters, which can be explicitly checked, the inequalities between the Hausdorff,
  box and affinity dimension of the attractor are strict. We generalize this result
  to overlapping constructions, where we allow complete columns to be shifted along
  the horizontal axis (as in Fraser and Shmerkin (2016 Ergod. Theor. Dyn. Syst. 36
  2463–81) and Pardo-Simón (2019 Ergod. Theor. Dyn. Syst. pp 733–63) or allow parallelograms
  to overlap within a column in a transversal way. Our main result is to show sufficient
  conditions under which these overlaps do not cause a drop of the dimension of the
  attractor. Several examples are provided to illustrate the results, including a
  self-affine smiley, a family of self-affine continuous curves, examples with overlaps
  and an application of our results to some three-dimensional systems.
