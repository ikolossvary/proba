abstract: In this paper, a sponge in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is the attractor of an
  iterated function system consisting of finitely many strictly contracting affine
  maps whose linear part is a diagonal matrix. A suitable separation condition is
  introduced under which a variational formula is proved for the $L^q$ spectrum
  of any self-affine measure defined on a sponge for all $q\in\mathbb{R}$. Apart
  from some special cases, even the existence of their box dimension was not proved
  before. Under certain conditions, the formula has a closed form which in general
  is an upper bound. The Frostman and box dimension of these measures is also determined.
  The approach unifies several existing results and extends them to arbitrary dimensions.
  The key ingredient is the introduction of a novel pressure function which aims to
  capture the growth rate of box counting quantities on sponges. We show that this
  pressure satisfies a variational principle which resembles the Ledrappier–Young
  formula for Hausdorff dimension.
