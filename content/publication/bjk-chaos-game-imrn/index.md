abstract: This paper studies how long it takes the orbit of the chaos game to reach
  a certain density inside the attractor of a strictly contracting IFS of which we
  only assume that its lower dimension is positive. We show that the rate of growth
  of this cover time is determined by the Minkowski dimension of the push-forward
  of the shift invariant measure with exponential decay of correlations driving the
  chaos game. Moreover, we bound the expected value of the cover time from above and
  below with multiplicative logarithmic correction terms. As an application, for Bedford–McMullen
  carpets, we completely characterise the family of probability vectors that minimise
  the Minkowski dimension of Bernoulli measures. Interestingly, these vectors have
  not appeared in any other aspect of Bedford–McMullen carpets before.
