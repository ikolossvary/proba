abstract: Intermediate dimensions were introduced to provide a spectrum of dimensions
interpolating between Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions for fractals
where these differ. In particular, the self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets
are a natural case for investigation, but until now only very rough bounds
for their intermediate dimensions have been found. In this paper, we determine
a precise formula for the intermediate dimensions
$\dim_{\, \theta }\Lambda $ of any Bedford-McMullen carpet~$\Lambda $
for the whole spectrum of~$\theta \in [0,1]$, in terms of a certain large
deviations rate function. The intermediate dimensions exist and are strictly
increasing in~$\theta $, and the function
$\theta \mapsto \dim_{\, \theta }\Lambda $ exhibits interesting features
not witnessed on any previous example, such as having countably many phase
transitions, between which it is analytic and strictly concave.
