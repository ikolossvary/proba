abstract: Intermediate dimensions were introduced to provide a spectrum of dimensions interpolating between Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions for fractals where these differ. In particular, Bedford-McMullen carpets are a natural case for investigation, but until now only very rough bounds for their intermediate dimensions have been found.
