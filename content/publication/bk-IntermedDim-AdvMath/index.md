abstract: Intermediate dimensions were introduced to provide a spectrum of dimensions interpolating between Hausdorﬀ and box-
counting dimensions for fractals where these diﬀer. In particular, the self-aﬃne Bedford–McMullen carpets are a natural 
case for investigation, but until now only very rough bounds for their intermediate dimensions have been found. In this 
paper, we determine a precise formula for the intermediate dimensions
