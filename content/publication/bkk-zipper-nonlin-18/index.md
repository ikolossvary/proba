abstract: We study the pointwise regularity of zipper fractal curves generated by affine mappings. Under the assumption of dominated splitting of index-1, we calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the level sets of the pointwise Hölder exponent for a subinterval of the spectrum. We give an equivalent characterization for the existence of regular pointwise Hölder exponent for Lebesgue almost every point. In this case, we extend the multifractal analysis to the full spectrum. In particular, we apply our results for de Rham's curve.
