abstract: We define a new metric between natural numbers induced by the $\ell_\infty$ norm of their unique prime signatures. In this space, we look at the natural analog of the number line and study the arithmetic function $L_\infty(N)$, which tabulates the cumulative sum of distances between consecutive natural numbers up to $N$ in this new metric.
